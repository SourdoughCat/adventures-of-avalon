# Adventures of Avalon

The **Adventures of Avalon** is my own playthrough of [The Adventurer](https://jameschip.itch.io/the-adventurer) combined with [Her Odyssey](https://mirror-lock.itch.io/her-odyssey). With the theme being around Arthurian Legends. 

I will list other systems as they arise, though will mostly use ones which are "simple" so it doesn't intrude on the journaling process.

# Day 1

<details><summary>Info</summary>

**Location**: Woods

**Looking for**: A lost treasure which is a new love that is not a weapon

**Raw Notes**
For as long as I remember, I've grown up as a hunter, living off the land with my parents, we're a small family you see. As I've grown older, and contribute to the family and (tribe?), I've began to see that I have potential, potential to grow and make a name for myself. To escape the constant druggery and bring glory to my families' name.

I prepare to leave where I am to prepare for a long arduous journey, the challenge is we're remote and distinct from most of civilisation and I don't know the way. I'm a resourceful person, having been a hunter my whole life, I will be fine, no matter how long the journey. I'm confident in my abilities. 

But first, I need to look for the key guide or shaman to keep me safe from my travels who will be my guiding light. My father told me that they will be the one to show me the way.

I stand amidst the whispering woods, the ancient trees towering above me like sentinels. The rustling leaves beneath my feet are a familiar comfort, a reminder of the life I've known since childhood. My family's humble cabin lies hidden deep within this forest, where my parents taught me the ways of the hunt and the secrets of the wild. Manga style, simple lines, pastel palette

For as long as I can remember, I've lived off the land, our small tribe bound together by tradition and necessity. Yet, as I've grown in strength and skill, a restless fire burns within me. I yearn to break free from the mundane routine, to forge a name that will echo beyond our secluded glade. My heart craves adventure, glory, and the thrill of the unknown.

The call to leave has become irresistible. I prepare for a perilous journey, one that will take me into the uncharted expanse beyond our woods. The path ahead is shrouded in uncertainty, but I've been honed by the wilderness. My hunter's instincts and resourcefulness will be my shield and sword.

Still, I know better than to tempt fate alone. My father's words echo in my mind: "Seek out the wise one, the shaman who walks between worlds." They will be my guiding light, my protector on the treacherous roads ahead. Legend says they possess the knowledge of the ancients, and the whispers of the forest itself.
I take a deep breath, shouldering my pack and quiver. The search begins. I will find this mysterious guide, and together we will embark on a journey that will change the course of my destiny forever.
